[Dictionaries](https://github.com/alvaro-cuesta/tokipona-helper/blob/master/dictionary/) are desperately needed. See [tokipona.json](https://github.com/alvaro-cuesta/tokipona-helper/blob/master/dictionary/tokipona.json) for an example. I'm (slowly) working in adapting [jan Pije's public domain lessons](http://rowa.giso.de/languages/toki-pona/english/toki-pona-lessons.pdf) but I could use some help.

Alternate dictionaries are very welcome too: old toki pona, new toki pona, with banned words, other destination languages, etc.

Suggestions, ideas, new meanings, but reports, etc. are VERY welcome! You can also submit your texts to be included in the preset texts.
